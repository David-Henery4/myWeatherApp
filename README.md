## Technologies used

This Project is built using **Html**, **Scss** and **javascript**.
I also used npm in order to install and use **parcel** as my bundler to compile the files for the final version. **Core.js** and **regenerator** were also used in order to polyfill the code and to make sure all modern javascript features are backwards compatiable. **Git** was used to create the repository and link to gitHub and was constantly updated thoughout the projects development. It's also being used for the live intergration between the repository and the live deployed version on netlify.

## What i learned

## Improvements to be made

There are a few small but noticeable improvements that will be added in the future:

- A render spinner to be added before data loads in for a more seemless transition.
- A loading bar animation on the input to enhance to design and experience.
- Change the time and date to the location a user has searched for.
- A celsius to fahrenheit conversion feature.

I'm sure more ideas and improvements will be added over time. :)
